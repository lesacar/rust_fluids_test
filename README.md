# rust_fluids_test
Originally was supposed to be a fluid simulation in rust, but instead I went with sand for now, the logic is currently bugged, 1 block wide pillars aren't possible, along with some other bugs that are visually annoying but don't interfere with the sand placement.
# Install
just git clone, cd rust_fluids_test && cargo run
